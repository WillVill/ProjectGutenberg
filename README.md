### Project Idea:
The project is about creating JavaScript application that allows to figure out which cities are mentioned in books from the Project Gutenberg. These cities will be stored in two different databases (MongoDB, Neo4j). For this project we have the following learning goals.

### Learning goals for the Testing class:
* Get familiar with TDD by doing it.
* Use BDD to create efficient tests.
* Acquire proficiency in continuous integration using Travis CI.
* Learn how to test with Gherkin/Cucumber (test our Node.Js backend).
* Get experience with test automation using Cucumber and Selenium hand in hand.
* Learn how to test the databases (Neo4j and MongoDB) with JavaScript
